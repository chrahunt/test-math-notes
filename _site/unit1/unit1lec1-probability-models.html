<!-- not deleted on drive -->
<p>$\newcommand{\pr}[1]{\mathbf{P}!\left(#1\right)}$</p>

<p>Terms:<br />
1. Probabilistic Model
2. Sample space</p>

<p>What are the two steps of constructing a probabilistic model?
1. Construct a sample space
2. Specify the likelihood of outcomes</p>

<p>What are the main properties of a sample space?
1. Mutually exclusive - no two outcomes can occur at the same time
2. Collectively exhaustive - every outcome is contained in the sample space.
3. At the right granularity - individual samples are at the level of detail that captures the information relevant to you</p>

<p>How is the sample space denoted?<br />
(\Omega)</p>

<p>For what kinds of models is a tree useful?<br />
Discrete sequential models.</p>

<p>What is an event?<br />
A subset of the sample space to which probability is assigned</p>

<p>Probabilities are in the range $[0, 1]$.</p>

<p>What are the probability axioms?
1. Nonnegativity: Given $A \subset \Omega, \pr{A} \ge 0$
2. Normalization: $\pr{\Omega} = 1$
3. Finite additivity: If $A \cap B = \varnothing$, then $\pr{A\cup B} = \pr{A} + \pr{B}$</p>

<p>What are some consequences of the probability axioms?
1. $\pr{A} \le 1$
2. Generalized finite additivity for disjoint events.
3. $\pr{A} + \pr{A^c} = 1$
4. If $A \subset B$, then $\pr{A} \le \pr{B}$
5. $\pr{A \cup B} = \pr{A} + \pr{B} - \pr{A \cap B}$
6. Union bound: $\pr{A \cup B} \le \pr{A} + \pr{B}$</p>

<p>What is the discrete uniform law?<br />
Given $\Omega$ of $n$ equally likely elements, and $A \subset \Omega, |A| = k$, then $\pr{A} = k \cdot \frac{1}{n}$</p>

<p>What are the steps of a probability calculation?
1. Specify the sample space
2. Specify a probability law (somehow)
3. Identify an event of interest
4. Calculateâ€¦</p>

<p>Strengthening of finite additivity axiom:
Countable additivity axiom:
If $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots$ is an infinite <strong>sequence</strong> of disjoint events, then $\pr{A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup \cdots} = \pr{A_1} + \pr{A_2} + \pr{A_3} + \cdots$</p>

<p>Geometric sum
infinite sum</p>

<p>Countable and uncountable.</p>

<p>Probabilities can be considered frequencies.<br />
Probabilities can describe beliefs, or betting preferences.</p>

<p>What is the role of probability theory?<br />
A framework for analyzing phenomena with uncertain outcomes
* rules for consistent reasoning
* used for predictions and decisions.</p>

<p>Statistics complements probability.</p>
